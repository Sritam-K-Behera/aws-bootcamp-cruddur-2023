### Using AWS CloudShell
Also in the above mentioned add on videos i got to know how to use cloudshell which is one of the many ways to access AWS services.


### Generating AWS Credentials & installing CLI
In the later steps, i generated credentials & installed CLI on to Gitpod for ease of access by following the instructions in week-1-again branch of instructors' project repo. 


### Recreating a Logical Diagram
This time i used lucidcharts to a much greater extent & build a whole logical diagram from scratch. Using the AWS service icon pack & uploading the momento icon was a whole experience in it's itself.

### Open a support ticket and request a service limit
I wanted to do this but upon some googling, i got to know that support is not very much available for free-tier accounts which totally makes sense.
